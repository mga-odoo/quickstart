Chapter 12: Reporting and Analytics for Growth
************************************************

With all operational and financial data centralized in one system, a bakery can move beyond simple bookkeeping and leverage its data for strategic insights and growth. Odoo provides a powerful suite of reporting and dashboarding tools to analyze performance across the entire business.

12.1 Using Standard Reports
===========================

Odoo comes with a wide range of pre-built reports that provide valuable insights out of the box. Key reports for a bakery include:
    *   **Sales Analysis Report**: Found in the **Sales** app, this report allows you to pivot and group your sales data by various dimensions. You can easily see your top-selling products, your most valuable customers, or sales performance by cashier.[41]
    *   **POS Orders Report**: This provides a detailed breakdown of all transactions that have gone through the Point of Sale.
    *   **Inventory Reports**: The Inventory app offers crucial reports like **Stock Valuation** (showing the financial value of your current inventory) and **Product Moves** (providing a detailed history of every stock movement for traceability).
    *   **Production Analysis**: In the **Manufacturing** app, this report helps you track production efficiency, analyze the cost of goods produced, and monitor scrap rates.

12.2 Creating Custom Dashboards for Bakery KPIs
================================================

While standard reports are powerful, a custom dashboard provides an at-a-glance, real-time view of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that matter most to your specific bakery. Generic reports are useful, but a dashboard tailored to the bakery's unique operational drivers enables faster and more effective decision-making.

A bakery owner needs to monitor several key metrics daily: total sales, ingredient costs, production waste, and best-selling items.[6] Navigating through multiple reports in different applications to gather this information is inefficient. Odoo's customizable dashboards allow you to pull data from any module into a single, consolidated view.[63]

By creating a "Bakery Operations Dashboard," the owner can add cards and graphs for critical KPIs, such as:
    *   A KPI card showing "Today's POS Sales" (from Point of Sale).
    *   A bar chart of the "Top 5 Selling Products this Week" (from Sales).
    *   A KPI card for "Scrap Value this Month" (from Manufacturing).
    *   A pie chart showing "Purchases by Ingredient Category" (from Purchase).

This provides a 360-degree view of the business on one screen, updated in real-time. For even more advanced analytics, third-party apps from the Odoo store, such as Dashboard Ninja, can provide pre-built templates and AI-driven insights to help identify trends and opportunities.[6]

12.3 Financial Reporting
========================

Ultimately, all operational activities culminate in financial results. Odoo's **Accounting** app provides the standard financial statements required to understand the bakery's overall profitability and financial position. Under **Reporting**, you can generate the following core reports at any time:
    *   **Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)**: This report shows your revenues and expenses over a specific period, revealing the bakery's profitability.
    *   **Balance Sheet**: This provides a snapshot of the bakery's assets, liabilities, and equity at a single point in time, indicating its overall financial health.
    *   **Cash Flow Statement**: This report tracks the movement of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.

These reports are generated automatically from the transactions recorded across the entire Odoo system, providing managers and owners with the accurate, up-to-date financial information they need to steer the business toward sustainable growth.[17, 18, 63]
