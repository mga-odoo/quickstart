Consulting Businesses
=====================
The decision to adopt a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is a pivotal moment for any organization. For service and consulting firms, this decision carries unique weight. Unlike businesses that trade in tangible goods, service firms deal in an intangible, yet highly valuable commodity: expertise, delivered over time. 

The core challenges of this sector—accurately tracking billable hours, managing project scope and profitability, maintaining strong client relationships, and ensuring a seamless flow from sales promises to delivery realities—demand a software solution that is not merely a collection of tools, but a truly integrated ecosystem. This is where Odoo presents its most compelling value proposition.

This guide is architected to serve as a definitive implementation playbook for Odoo in the service and consulting industry. It is intended for the Odoo implementation consultant and the forward-thinking business owner who seeks to leverage technology not just for incremental improvements, but for fundamental business transformation. We will journey through the entire implementation process, from the high-level strategic decisions of methodology and project governance to the granular, hands-on configuration of Odoo's core applications.
